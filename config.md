## Info
⦁ This add-on allows you to open a Searchable Deck List from either the Decks Menu or the Browser Menu.   
⦁ The functionality can be triggered via the "Ctrl+Alt+D" shortcut  
⦁ Each instance of the Deck List remains independent so as to allow you to have different deck names handy.   
⦁ Minimizing the Window simply positions it in bottom Left of the Screen, this way multiple deck list searches can be stacked and stored for later.  

## Changing Shortcut
⦁ By default, "Ctrl+Alt+D" has been assigned as the shortcut to trigger the Deck List popup from both the Decks Menu and the Browser Menu  
⦁ The shortcut can be changed by clicking on "View Files" below, opening the "__init__.py" file and modifying Lines 85 and 93.  
⦁ Change the "Ctrl+Alt+D" from Lines 85 and 93 to a more desirable shortcut.  

## Changing Window Size
⦁ By default, the Minimum Window Size has been set to 1200*900
⦁ This can be change by clicking on "View Files" below, opening the "__init__.py" file and modifying Line 25.  
⦁ Change the values in window.setMinimumSize(1200, 800) from Line 25 to a more desirable value. 

## Support
I have nothing to plug here. Just keep working hard and making progress!
